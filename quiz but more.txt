1. **Which of the following best describes why Luau uses both forward and backward barriers in its garbage collection system?**  
   - A) Forward barriers are faster, while backward barriers are more thorough.  
   - B) Forward barriers advance GC progress, while backward barriers defer work for efficiency.  
   - C) Forward barriers are used only for weak tables, and backward barriers are used for strong references.  
   - D) Forward barriers are used during the sweeping phase, while backward barriers are used during the marking phase.  

2. **What is the purpose of the `grayagain` list in Luau's GC implementation?**  
   - A) To store objects that need to be recolored from gray to black during the atomic phase.  
   - B) To handle objects that were marked as gray but were modified after the initial marking phase.  
   - C) To keep track of weak table entries that need processing during the atomic phase.  
   - D) To optimize the sweeping process by deferring work to later steps.  

3. **How does the Luau garbage collector handle strings during incremental marking?**  
   - A) Strings are marked as black and added to the gray set.  
   - B) Strings are treated as semantically black but are never marked as part of a gray list.  
   - C) Strings are treated as weak references and processed during the atomic phase.  
   - D) Strings are marked as white and recolored during the sweeping phase.  

4. **Why are threads treated differently from other objects in Luau's GC system?**  
   - A) Threads cannot be marked as black due to stack slot monitoring limitations.  
   - B) Threads are always treated as weak references to avoid breaking the tri-color invariant.  
   - C) Threads are marked as gray during execution and black when inactive to optimize GC performance.  
   - D) Threads require special handling during sweeping to account for active stack slots.
